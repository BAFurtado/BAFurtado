### Hi there, I'm a researcher. 

Originally an architect, I became a geographer, then an economist, and I'm about to become a (methodology) developer working with public policies!
I'm also a newbie pantser: https://sites.google.com/view/bernardo-alves-furtado/novel

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Agent-based Models**, 
 ðŸŒ± learning python for the **web** 
 
 ðŸ‘¯ Would love to have collaborators on Policy Modeling and PolicySpace2, here: https://github.com/BAFurtado/PolicySpace2
 
 ðŸ’¬ I'm also a teacher, so feel free to ask me about agent-based modeling or python 
 
 ðŸ“« Find me at https://twitter.com/furtadobb or at https://sites.google.com/view/bernardo-alves-furtado
