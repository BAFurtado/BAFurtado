### Hi there, I'm a researcher. 

Originally an architect, I became a geographer, then an economist. Nowadays, I'm mostly a modeler working with agent-based models (ABM) AND public policies! Find my open source production, here: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernardo_Furtado

I have also written a novel around women violence, as a newbie **pantser**: Linger no longer and check it out https://www.amazon.com/Linger-Longer-Diana-runner-helper-ebook/dp/B08D6WQHG9

 ðŸ”­ Keywords for me are **Agent-based Models**, and ðŸŒ± **python**. but I need collaborators on Policy Modeling and PolicySpace2, here: https://github.com/BAFurtado/PolicySpace2
 
 ðŸ’¬ I'm also a teacher ðŸ“« Find me at https://twitter.com/furtadobb or at https://sites.google.com/view/bernardo-alves-furtado
