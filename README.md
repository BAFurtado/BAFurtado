### Hi there, I'm a researcher. 

Originally an architect, I became a geographer, then an economist. Nowadays, I'm mostly a methodology developer working with agent-based models (ABM) ANDpublic policies! Find my open source production, here: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernardo_Furtado

I have written a novel around women violence, as a newbie **pantser**: https://sites.google.com/view/bernardo-alves-furtado/novel
